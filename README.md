**Use-Case:** Customers do monitor vSphere environment with solutions like out-of-the-box PRTG and lack sufficient alerting. They also don’t have Aria Operations in place.


**Problem Statement:** vCenter Alerts either spam you, don’t notify you enough or alerts are not configured at all – also cumbersome to configure manually


**TL;DR:** define vCenter alerts based on a csv file, send (multiple) notifications based on severity
